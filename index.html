		<h3>Codify your release process</h3>
		<p class="bigger">
			Tramline lets you codify the multiple parts of your release process as the steps of a release train. We do this with <mark>minimal disruption</mark> to the existing investments of the engineering team. 
		</p>
		
		<h3>Integrate discrete systems</h3>
		<p class="bigger">
			We integrate with existing <mark>CI pipelines</mark> that create various types of builds. We work with existing <mark>build deployment channels</mark> like Play Store and App Store, and also with Slack and Firebase App Distribution.
		</p>
		
		<h3>Describe your dance</h3>
		<p class="bigger">
			Using the release train model, teams can describe the coordinated dance that happens <mark>between the stakeholders</mark> (developers, EMs, product, QA) as sequential steps that last over many days or weeks, including blocking steps like getting explicit sign off. 
		</p>
		<p class="bigger">
			Participants get <mark>notified at every step</mark> about the state of the release. This isn’t just limited to a single train – teams can describe as many types of release trains as they want. For example, apart from the regular production release, one can design a nightly train or a beta testers train.
		</p>
		
		<h3>Observe the world</h3>		
		<p class="bigger">
			 Since the complete release process can be managed from one place, <mark>anyone</mark>, can drive the release and not just senior engineers. Non-technical stakeholders get a clear overview of the state of the release as it happens. 
		</p>
