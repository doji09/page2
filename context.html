			<h3>Context</h3>
			<p>
				Modern smartphones and their app stores are very new in the industry. iOS and Android saw exponential growth only after 2010. For a long time, this did not impact engineering because apps were either small in scope or secondary channels to a business.
			</p>
			<p>
				This changed after the <u>wild success of app-only businesses</u> like Uber, Instagram, Swiggy, Gojek, etc. Today, it is common for businesses to be built around an app experience, which means apps are critical to the success of those businesses.
			</p>
			
			<img src="backend-tooling.png" width="340px" style="background-color: #eee; float: left; margin-right: 1rem;"/>
			
			<p>
				Engineering teams are acutely aware that the state of developer tooling for backend and frontend teams is a decade ahead of what mobile developers get to use regularly.
			</p>
			<p>
				As a result, an app-first business tends to spend a lot of effort ensuring its apps are stable and perform reliably. This <u>adds engineering overhead</u> because now the organization must stitch together different tools to solve their needs. They must also maintain this internal tooling while also trying to meet business requirements.
			</p>
			<h3>
				A multi-faceted problem
			</h3>
			<p>
				This is not an easy problem, nor is it one that permits a singular solution, so with Tramline we’ve chosen to start with simplifying the deployment process. 
			</p>
				
			<p>
				Releasing apps is key to the success of an app-first business. It is a consistently <u>repeated transaction</u> because it is what delivers value to customers, ergo an incorrect build being released incurs a very high cost.
			</p>
			<p>
				Further, the Play Store and App Store are walled gardens with Google and Apple setting all the rules, which can and do change many times. Continuous delivery, a proven valuable practice, is impossible in these stores and so is the rollback of bad builds. Even the control of over-the-air updates rests with the user and the device. In that sense, apps are much more <u>like on-premise software</u> that cannot be frequently updated.
			</p>

			<img src="stakeholders.png" width="340px" style="background-color: #eee; float: left; margin-right: 1rem;"/>			
			<p>
				For the vast majority of the app ecosystem, releasing a new version involves many steps and multiple stakeholders. The process is simple when the team and product are small and do not move fast. However, for large-scale fast-moving products, app releases <u>become exponentially more complicated</u> and begin to look something like this:
			</p>
			
			<ul>
				<li>Agreeing on a date to ensure all activities are completed on time
				</li>
				<li>Deciding features, improvements, and bug fixes that will be shipped
				</li>
				<li>Making builds pointing to various (staging, preprod, prod) API envs
				</li>
				<li>Automated and manual testing of builds by developers and QA teams
				</li>
				<li>Product sign off on the correctness of what is being shipped
				</li>
				<li>Updating builds with fixes/changes so they align with the release decision
				</li>
				<li>Notifying stakeholders of the progress of the release
				</li>
				<li>Staged rollout of the final build and monitoring metrics to ensure stability
				</li>
				<li>Creating and deploying "hotfix" builds if something critical is amiss
				</li>
				<li>Repeat all this again!
				</li>
			</ul>
			<p>
				The release process is documented in a tool (e.g. Google Docs, Confluence) as a series of steps and checklists that have to be followed. The process is run by a person <u>assigned as the release pilot</u> – someone who is accountable for a correct run. The pilot’s role is one that often rotates within the engineering team because when a release is not being run the pilot can go back to their regular development duties. Some very large scale companies even have dedicated release engineering teams.
			</p>
			
			<aside>
				<p>
				“Worse than a checklist is one that cannot be relied on.”
				</p>
			</aside>
			<p>
				The release process checklist, like all checklists, <u>is a maintenance burden</u> because the process, tools, or steps change over time. Small out-of-band tasks may be done by a team (or specific engineers) that may never get mentioned in the checklist.
			</p>
			<p>
				Human factors also play another role here. Churn in the team is expected at all organizations, and every time that happens the team must make sure that all release-related knowledge has been transferred from memory and committed to documentation.
			</p>
			
			<h3>
				A clear aim
			</h3>
			<p>
				Our mission is to equip teams with tools that help them <u>focus on delivering business value</u>, and not on ancillary activities like driving a release checklist. With Tramline, we hope to <u>reduce the uncertainty</u> around releases for everyone involved and <u>reduce the opportunity cost</u> incurred by the organization because of the aforementioned overheads.
